Some examples of reptiles include snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodilians.</p><p class="blog-text">They are ectothermic, which means that they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, and they are adapted to a wide range of habitats, including deserts, forests, and swamps.</p><p class="blog-text">Reptiles have a number of adaptations that help them to survive in their environments. For example, many reptiles have scales or armor-like plates on their skin, which provides protection from predators and the elements.</p><p class="blog-text">Some reptiles, such as chameleons and anoles, have the ability to change color, which helps them to blend in with their surroundings and avoid predators. Many reptiles also have specialized organs, such as venom glands or heat-sensing pits, which help them to locate prey and defend themselves.</p><p class="blog-text">Reptiles are an important part of the ecosystem and play important roles as predators and prey.
