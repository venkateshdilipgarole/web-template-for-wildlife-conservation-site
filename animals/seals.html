Seals are adapted to life in the water and on land, and they have streamlined bodies and webbed feet that allow them to swim efficiently.</p><p class="blog-text">They are known for their ability to dive to great depths in search of food and can stay underwater for long periods of time. Seals are also intelligent and social animals, and they are often seen basking in the sun on land or playing in the water.</p><p class="blog-text">Seals have a layer of fat, called blubber, under their skin that helps to keep them warm in cold water. This blubber also serves as an energy reserve when food is scarce.</p><p class="blog-text">They also have keen senses, including excellent eyesight and hearing, which they use to locate prey and navigate in the water. They also have a well-developed sense of smell.</p><p class="blog-text">Seals are protected by international conservation laws and are considered vulnerable or endangered in some areas due to habitat loss and overhunting.</p></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer section"><div class="footer-container container"><ul class="footer-list"><li><a href="#" class="footer-link">Terms of use</a></li><li><a href="#" class="footer-link">Privacy &amp; Policy</a></li></ul><p class="copyright">Copyright 2022&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mde3" target="_blank" class="copyright-link">Mabior</a>.&nbsp;All Rights Reserved.</p></div></footer><a href="#" class="scrollup" id="scroll-up"><i class="bx bx-up-arrow-alt scrollup__icon"></i></a><script src="../assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
